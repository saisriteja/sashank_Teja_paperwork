## Grad Cam
* Tring to implement grad cam
* It is used to classify the important parts of the images(spectrograms)
* Using gradient with respect to convolutional features
## Variational Auto Encoders
* Dimensionality Reduction:The process of reducing the number of features that describe some data.
* Using Dimensionality reduction, we can select the most important features in the compressed.
* After training is complete, we can use the encoded data that has been dimensionality reduced. This can include Clustering, Classification or Visualization of data
